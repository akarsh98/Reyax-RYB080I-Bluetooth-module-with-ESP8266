# Reyax-RYB080I-Bluetooth-module-with-ESP8266

Video tutorial : 

RYB080l is a standalone BT module with an extremely small footprint ideal for small IoT connected devices like wearables, we use it today.

This project of mine is more of a learning curve to understand the working of the small Bluetooth module from Reyax.

First, we will understand the module alone and try to use it directly, then we will connect it to an ESP8266 and make a simple LED control project.

At the end of the tutorial, we will be able to use the RYB080l module standalone and with micro like esp8266.
